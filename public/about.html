<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a creative and organized man. With my wife Sara, I love to travel and discover new places, by learning from new people, cultures and habits.</p>

<p>I love also help in construction and renovating projects, something I continue doing as a tiler in many countries as volunteer.</p>
